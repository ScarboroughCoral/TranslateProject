4 open source productivity tools on my wishlist
======
Find out what the open source world needs to work on in the final
article in our series on 20 ways to be more productive with open source
in 2020.
![Two diverse hands holding a globe][1]

Last year, I brought you 19 days of new (to you) productivity tools for 2019. This year, I'm taking a different approach: building an environment that will allow you to be more productive in the new year, using tools you may or may not already be using.

### But what about…

When searching for productivity apps, I never find everything I want, and I almost always miss something great that my readers share with me. So, as I bring this series to a close, it's time [again][2] to talk about some of the topics I failed to cover in this year's series.

#### Chatting in Vim

I tried. I really, _really_ tried to get chat to work in Vim, but it was not to be. The one package I was able to find, [VimIRC.vim][4], never did work for me, and I tried for a few days to no avail. The other option I explored was [Irc it][5], which requires a lot more [effort to set up][6] than I could fit into my available space or time. I tried, I really did, and for the Vim users out there, I'm sorry I wasn't able to get something workable for you.

#### Org mode

![Org Mode in Emacs][7]

I love [Org Mode][8], and I use it daily. I could spend several days _just_ talking about Org. It provides basic [task tracking][9]; Google [calendar][10] sync and [CalFW][11] integration; rich text documents, websites, and presentations; linking to all the things; and; and; and…

I expect you will hear more from me about Org in 2020 because it really is pretty cool.

#### GUI programs

In 2019's productivity series, I shared a lot of programs with a graphical user interface (GUI), and this year almost all are command-line applications. There are some great graphical programs to help with some of the things I talked about this year—[mail][12] programs to talk to Maildir mailboxes, calendar programs to read local calendar files, [weather][13] apps, and so on. I even tried several new-to-me things to see if they would fit with the overall theme. With the exception of [twin][14], I didn't feel that there were any GUI programs that were new (to me) or notable (again, to me) to write about this year. And that brings me to…

#### Mobile

More and more people are using tablets (sometimes in conjunction with a laptop) as their primary device. I use my phone for most of my social media and instant messaging, and, more often than not, I use my tablet (OK, let's be honest, _tablets_) to read or browse the web. It isn't that open source mobile apps aren't out there, that's for sure, but they didn't fit with my themes this year. There is a lot going on with open source and mobile apps, and I'm watching carefully for things that can help me be more productive on my phone and tablet.

### Your turn

Thank you very much for reading the series this year. Please comment with what you think I missed or need to look at for 2021. And as I say on the [Productivity Alchemy][15] podcast: "Remember folks: Stay productive!"
